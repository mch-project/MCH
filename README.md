MCH is a database management system (DBMS)* based on open source database and software.

The System, developed by Mexico and adapted by the Programme of Cooperation for the Iberoamerican National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs), has been transferred to WMO in 2011.

Originally developed in Spanish, the whole software interface and the database is multilingual and can be translated to any UTF8 language easyly trhough an external text file. Currently has been translated into English and French.

MCH can be used on a single computer (stand alone configuration) or in a network configuration. It allows also to connect automatic stations and gather real time data.
